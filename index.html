                <h3>Top 10 Game Jam Entry</h3>
                <p>I was part of a two man team that coded and did the art for the game Brewmaster Seige, this was done using Unity and Aseprite. I participated in designing everything from UI, gameplay to
                    enemy AI. It was fun learning so many new skills and the project lasted around a week.

                <h3>C++ Gameplay project</h3>
                <p>I was challenged with creatively making a game using c++ in which a cat must find their kittens, focusing only on functionality
                     I coded a customisable maze with active enemy AI and advanced pathfinding of both enemy and kitten(NPC) characters, alongside this i added
                     usable advanced physics and mechanics with some basic UI to make it feel like a game. Multiplayer was also explored alongside this and will
                     be present in future updates.

                <h3>Procedural Generation Of Biomes In Games</h3>
                <p>Using unity i programmed an effiecient procedural generated environment, i made it generate multiple environments such as desert, grassy and island biomes.
                    I supplimented this with extensive research which was the focus of this dissertation project.

                    <h3>Febuary 2020</h3>
                    <p>I did the programming entry test for the job to get an insight into the recruitment process.
                         I participated in day-to-day tasks such as sorting bugs. I assisted and took notes during the company’s weekly stand-up meeting.
                          I learnt from the senior developer how programming has evolved and developed in recent years into forms such as AGILE.</p>

                    <h3>October 2018</h3>
                    <p>I supported the IT manager; I helped oversee and test a new program for loading boxes. 
                        The new system would sort out boxes in the most efficient amount of space minimising cost. 
                        I particularly enjoyed being able to watch and learn how to program in html, also how producers ship and sell their goods to retailers. 
                        In addition, I helped with tasks such as filing and fixing broken machinery.</p>
